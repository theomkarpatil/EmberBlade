# EmberBlade
Ember Blade is a top down hack and slash survival game. You fend off 6 waves of enemies of various kinds as fast as possible to beat the highscore.

**Ember Blade was developed in a span of 3 days** during the **July 2024 ScoreSpace Jam Game Jam** for the theme "**Overheat**". Another 3 days were spent bug fixing, code optimization and adding the Facet mechanic to the game.
